# 👨‍🎓 Face Recognition Based Attendance Management System

A smart attendance management system that combines **AI-powered face recognition** with a **web-based dashboard** to automate and streamline the process of recording and managing student attendance.  

This project was developed as a **college group project** by a team of 4 ( Ankit Sharma, Pratik Neupane, Shreeya Poudel, Samekshya Baniya ), to demonstrate the practical application of Artificial Intelligence in solving real-world problems like classroom attendance.

## 📌 About the Project

This system integrates two main parts:

1. **Face Recognition Model (Python)**  
   - Captures student faces through a webcam.  
   - Compares live faces with pre-saved images in the database.  
   - Automatically logs attendance in a CSV file if a match is found.  
   - Prevents duplicate entries for the same day.

2. **Web Application (PERN Stack)**  
   - Provides separate dashboards for **Admin, Teachers, and Students**.  
   - Allows admins/teachers to view, manage, and download attendance reports.  
   - Students can log in to check their attendance records.  
   - API integration with the Python model for automated data transfer.

The system is currently a **local prototype** for demonstration purposes but can be scaled into a cloud-based, real-time attendance management platform.
